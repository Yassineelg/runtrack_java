# Day 3 - Collections, Generics, and Java Streams

Welcome to Day 3 of the Java training program at La Plateforme! In today's session, we focused on collections, generics, and Java streams. This day was all about building a solid foundation in these fundamental Java concepts.

## My Day 3 Accomplishments

I had an engaging day, working on various exercises that allowed me to apply my knowledge of collections, generics, and Java streams. Let's take a look at what I accomplished today:

### Job 01 - Sum of Even Numbers

- Created a list of integers and added numbers to it.
- Calculated the sum of all even numbers in the list.

### Job 02 - Unique Words

- Processed a list of words to identify and display the words that appear only once.

### Job 03 - Student Records

- Utilized a `Map` to store student records with their matriculation numbers as keys.
- Added several students to the map and displayed them in ascending order of matriculation numbers.

### Job 04 - The Generic Box

- Designed a generic class `Boite<T>` capable of adding and retrieving elements.
- Demonstrated the usage of this generic class with different types.

### Job 05 - Stream Transformation

- Leveraged Java streams to manipulate a list of numbers.
- Doubled each number, filtered out those greater than 10, and collected the result into a list.

### Job 06 - Filtering Strings

- Applied Java streams to filter a list of words.
- Selected words that start with the letter 'a' and have a length of 3.

### Job 07 - Handling Null with Optional

- Implemented a method to find the length of a potentially null string using `Optional`.
- If the string is null, it returns "Cha√Æne non fournie."

## Key Takeaways

- Strengthened Java programming skills.
- Proficient in collection manipulation.
- Understanding of generics and their utility.
- Streamlined data processing with Java streams.
- Improved exception handling expertise.
