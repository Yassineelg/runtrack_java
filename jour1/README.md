# Day 1 - Java Fundamentals and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Welcome to Day 1 of the Java training program at La Plateforme! This day is dedicated to revisiting the basics of the Java programming language and delving into fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The goal is to establish a common foundation among all students and provide hands-on practice.

Day 1 is packed with practical exercises that will help you become familiar with Java and its core concepts. Here's an overview of what you'll cover on this day:

### Job 01

Write a program that asks the user for their name and then displays a welcoming message.

### Job 02

Create a `Voiture` (Car) class with attributes (brand, color, speed) and methods (start, accelerate by 10 km/h, stop). Test this class by creating an instance, starting the car, accelerating twice, and then stopping it.

### Job 03

Build a `Calculatrice` (Calculator) class with methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Test this class with user-input numbers.

### Job 04

Develop a `CompteBancaire` (Bank Account) class with a balance and methods for depositing, withdrawing, and displaying the balance. Ensure that the balance cannot go negative.

### Job 05

Simulate rolling two dice and display the result of each die and their sum.

### Job 06

Create an `Etudiant` (Student) class with attributes for the student's name and a list of grades. Add methods to add a grade, find the highest and lowest grades, and calculate the average.

### Job 07

Design classes for various shapes (e.g., `Cercle` - Circle, `Carre` - Square) with methods to calculate their areas. Test these classes by calculating the areas of different shapes.
