# Day 1 - Java Fundamentals and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Welcome to Day 1 of the Java training program at La Plateforme! My journey on this day was all about revisiting the basics of the Java programming language and delving into fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). I laid a solid foundation for my Java knowledge and practical skills through engaging hands-on exercises and exploration.

## My Day 1 Highlights

On this dynamic day, I achieved a series of key milestones while learning and experimenting with Java's core concepts. Here's an overview of my significant accomplishments and discoveries:

### Job 01 - Warm Welcome

- Kicked off the day by crafting a program that interactively solicits the user's name and warmly displays a personalized welcome message.

### Job 02 - Car Adventures

- Embarked on the creation of a `Voiture` (Car) class, equipped with attributes like brand, color, and speed.
- Implemented essential methods for starting the car, accelerating it by 10 km/h, and smoothly bringing it to a stop.
- Thoroughly tested the class by initiating the car, accelerating it twice, and skillfully halting its motion.

### Job 03 - Calculator Magic

- Delved into the realm of calculations and computations by designing a `Calculatrice` (Calculator) class.
- Constructed methods for essential arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Mastered the art of handling user-input numbers while working with this versatile class.

### Job 04 - Banking Brilliance

- Cultivated financial wisdom by developing the `CompteBancaire` (Bank Account) class.
- Empowered the class with a balance attribute and enriched it with methods for depositing, withdrawing, and meticulously tracking the balance.
- Ensured that the account's balance remained steadfastly non-negative, fostering robust financial management.

### Job 05 - Dice Roller

- Gained insight into probability and randomness by simulating the roll of two dice.
- Skillfully generated random numbers, unraveling the outcome of each die and skillfully calculating their sum.

### Job 06 - Scholarly Pursuits

- Delved into the academic realm by crafting the `Etudiant` (Student) class.
- Managed the student's name and skillfully curated a list of grades.
- Implemented methods for adding grades, identifying the highest and lowest scores, and performing precise average calculations.

### Job 07 - Shape Wizardry

- Showcased my mathematical prowess by architecting classes for diverse geometric shapes, including `Cercle` (Circle) and `Carre` (Square).
- Expertly programmed methods to compute the areas of these shapes, pushing the boundaries of mathematical precision.

## My Day 1 Achievements

- Nurtured a strong command of Java's foundational principles.
- Acquired valuable hands-on experience in applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
- Laid a firm groundwork for crafting Java applications with confidence and precision.

As I wrap up Day 1 of the Java training program at La Plateforme, I am excited to share my remarkable journey and accomplishments with the community. This repository stands as a testament to my dedication and burgeoning expertise in Java development. Join me on my coding adventure, as I continue to learn, create, and innovate!
