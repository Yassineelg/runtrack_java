# Day 5 - Collections, Lambdas, and Stream API

Welcome to Day 5 of the Java training program at La Plateforme! This day is all about exploring collections, lambdas, and the Stream API in Java. These fundamental concepts play a crucial role in Java programming and provide powerful tools for data manipulation and processing.

## My Day 5 Accomplishments

In today's session, I delved into collections, lambdas, and the Stream API. Here's a summary of the tasks I completed:

### Job 01 - ArrayList

- Created a class `ArrayListArgumentExercice` to populate an ArrayList with command-line arguments and display them.
- Demonstrated the use of ArrayList to store and access data efficiently.

### Job 02 - HashSet

- Developed a class `HashSetArgumentExercice` to add command-line arguments to a HashSet and display them.
- Highlighted the uniqueness feature of HashSet, which prevents duplicate entries.

### Job 03 - HashMap

- Implemented a class `HashMapArgumentExercice` to treat command-line arguments as key-value pairs and add them to a HashMap.
- Showcased the ability of HashMap to store and retrieve data using keys.

### Job 04 - Lambda Expressions

- Created a class `LambdaArgumentExercice` that uses lambda expressions to check if a given string has a length greater than a specified value.
- Explored the concise syntax and flexibility of lambda expressions in Java.

### Job 05 - Stream Filtering

- Developed a class `StreamFilterExercice` that utilizes the Stream API to filter and display numbers greater than a specified value from command-line arguments.
- Demonstrated how streams simplify data manipulation and filtering.

### Job 06 - Stream Mapping

- Designed a class `StreamMapExercice` to convert names provided as command-line arguments to uppercase using the Stream API.
- Explored the convenience of mapping functions in stream operations.

### Job 07 - Stream Collecting

- Created a class `StreamCollectExercice` that combines filtering and collecting using the Stream API.
- Filtered numbers from command-line arguments below a specified threshold and displayed the result.
- Showed how streams can streamline data processing tasks.

## Key Takeaways

- Strengthened my understanding of Java collections, including ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap.
- Explored the versatility of lambda expressions in simplifying code.
- Gained proficiency in using the Stream API for data manipulation and processing.
- Developed skills in filtering, mapping, and collecting data using streams.
- Learned how to handle different types of data efficiently in Java.

Day 5 has equipped me with valuable tools and techniques for working with data and collections in Java. I'm excited to continue exploring advanced Java concepts in the upcoming sessions!

Thank you for following my Java journey at La Plateforme!
