# Day 2 - Advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Error Handling

Welcome to Day 2 of the Java training program at La Plateforme! Today's session was focused on advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and error handling in Java. Throughout the day, I made significant progress in expanding my Java knowledge and practical skills.

## My Day 2 Accomplishments

On this productive day, I successfully tackled a series of hands-on exercises and learning challenges. Here's an overview of my key accomplishments and what I've learned today:

### Job 01 - Enhancing the Bank Account

- Extended the `CompteBancaire` (Bank Account) class introduced on Day 1.
- Introduced the concepts of checking and savings accounts.
- Implemented functionality for the savings account, including an interest rate and a method to add interest.

### Job 02 - Swimmers and Fish

- Created a `Nageur` (Swimmer) interface with a `nager()` method.
- Implemented this interface in two classes: `Homme` (Man) and `Poisson` (Fish).
- In `Homme`, the method displays "L'homme nage."
- In `Poisson`, it displays "Le poisson nage rapidement."

### Job 03 - Animal Sounds

- Developed an abstract `Animal` class with an abstract `faireDuBruit()` (makeNoise) method.
- Extended this class with `Chat` (Cat), `Chien` (Dog), and `Oiseau` (Bird) classes.
- Each class implemented the `faireDuBruit()` method to display an appropriate sound.

### Job 04 - Custom Exception Handling

- Created a method to divide two numbers.
- Implemented a custom `DivisionParZeroException` to handle division by zero scenarios.

### Job 05 - Speed Limit Exception

- Modified the `Voiture` (Car) class from Day 1 to throw a custom `VitesseLimiteDepasseeException` (SpeedLimitExceeded) if the car exceeds 100 km/h.

### Job 06 - Musical Instruments

- Defined an `Instrument` interface with a `jouer()` (play) method.
- Implemented this interface in the `Guitare` (Guitar) and `Piano` classes.
- `Guitare` now displays "La guitare joue un air rock."
- `Piano` displays "Le piano joue une m√©lodie douce."

### Job 07 - Exception Handling Mastery

- Created a program capable of handling and managing multiple types of exceptions: `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, and `ArithmeticException`.

## Key Takeaways

- Advanced Java programming skills.
- Proficiency in error handling techniques.
- In-depth understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
